SENSOR_CONFIG=/usr/local/share/silk/sensors.conf

# The full path to the root of the tree under which the packed SiLK
# Flow files will be written.  Used by --root-directory.

# ${DATA_ROOTDIR}.
SITE_CONFIG=/netflow/silk.conf

# Specify the path to the packing-logic plug-in that rwflowpack should
# load and use.  The plug-in provides functions that determine into
# which class and type each flow record will be categorized and the
# format of the files that rwflowpack will write.  When SiLK has been
# configured with hard-coded packing logic (i.e., when
# --enable-packing-logic was specified to the configure script), this
# value should be empty.  A default value for this switch may be
# specified in the ${SITE_CONFIG} site configuration file.  This value
# is ignored when INPUT_MODE is "respool".
PACKING_LOGIC=

# Data input mode.  Valid values are:
#  * "stream" mode to read from the network or from probes that have
#    poll-directories
#  * "fcfiles" to process flowcap files on the local disk
#  * "respool" to process SiLK flow files maintaining the sensor and
#    class/type values that already exist on those records.
INPUT_MODE=stream

# Directory in which to look for incoming flowcap files in "fcfiles"
# mode or for incoming SiLK files in "respool" mode
INCOMING_DIR=${statedirectory}/incoming

# Directory to move input files to after successful processing.  When
# in "stream" mode, these are the files passed to any probe with a
# poll-directory directive.  When in "fcfiles" mode, these are the
# flowcap files.  When in "respool" mode, these are the SiLK Flow
# files.  If not set, the input files are not archived but are deleted
# instead.
ARCHIVE_DIR=${statedirectory}/archive

# When using the ARCHIVE_DIR, normally files are stored in
# subdirectories of the ARCHIVE_DIR.  If this variable's value is 1,
# files are stored in ARCHIVE_DIR itself, not in subdirectories of it.
FLAT_ARCHIVE=0

# Directory to move an input file into if there is a problem opening
# the file.  If this value is not set, rwflowpack will exit when it
# encounters a problem file.  When in "fcfiles" mode, these are the
# flowcap files.  When in "stream" mode, these are the files passed to
# any probe with a poll-directory directive.
ERROR_DIR=  #${statedirectory}/error

# Data output mode.  As of SiLK-3.6.0, valid values are
# "local-storage", "incremental-files", and "sending".
#
# For compatiblity with previous releases prior to SiLK-3.6.0, "local"
# is an alias for "local-storage" and "remote" and is an alias for
# "sending".
#
# In "local-storage" (aka "local") mode, rwflowpack writes the records
# to hourly files in the repository on the local disk.  The root of
# the repository must be specified by the DATA_ROOTDIR variable.
#
# In "incremental-files" mode, rwflowpack creates small files (called
# incremental files) that must be processed by rwflowappend to create
# the hourly files.  The incremental-files are created and stored in a
# single directory named by the INCREMENTAL_DIR variable.
#
# In "sending" (aka "remote") mode, rwflowpack also creates
# incremental files.  The files are created in directory specified by
# the INCREMENTAL_DIR variable and then moved to directory specified
# by the SENDER_DIR variable.
OUTPUT_MODE=local-storage

# When the OUTPUT_MODE is "sending", this is the destination directory
# in which the incremental files are finally stored to await
# processing by rwflowappend, rwsender, or another process.
SENDER_DIR=${statedirectory}/sender-incoming

# When OUTPUT_MODE is "incremental-files" or "sending", this is the
# directory where the incremental files are initially built.  In
# "incremental-files" mode, the files remain in this directory.  In
# "sending" mode, the incremental files are moved to the SENDER_DIR
# directory.

# The type of compression to use for packed files.  Left empty, the
# value chosen at compilation time will be used.  Valid values are
# "best" and "none".  Other values are system-specific (the available
# values are listed in the description of the --compression-method
# switch in the output of rwflowpack --help).

# poll-directory probe entries for new files, in seconds.  This may be
# left blank, and will default to 15.

# Interval between periodic flushes of open SiLK Flow files to disk,
# in seconds.  This may be left blank, and will default to 120.

# Maximum number of SiLK Flow files to have open for writing
# simultaneously.  This may be left blank, and will default to 64

# Whether rwflowpack should use advisory write locks.  1=yes, 0=no.
# Set to zero if messages like "Cannot get a write lock on file"
# appear in rwflowpack's log file.

# Whether rwflowpack should include the input and output SNMP
# interfaces and the next-hop-ip in the output files.  1=yes, 0=no.
# The default is no, and these values are not stored to save disk
# space.  (The input and output fields contain VLAN tags when the
# sensor.conf file contains the attribute "interface-values vlan".)

# The type of logging to use.  Valid values are "legacy" and "syslog".
LOG_TYPE=legacy
